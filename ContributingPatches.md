# Contributing Patches #

If you want to submit a patch to IMMS, great! Please follow these conventions. When in doubt, be consistent - i.e. follow what's already in the code, so the code itself is a style guide.


  * Prefer // to `/*` even for multi-line comments
  * Obey the 80c line limit (with the possible exception of URLs)
  * Use spaces not tabs. This makes sure that no matter what a person's tab width is set to the code looks uniform. Usually you can set your editor to substitute tabs with spaces.
  * Always follow // with a space
  * If // is not at the beginning of a line, allow two spaces between it and the code
