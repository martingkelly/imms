A list of patches that need to be reviewed and approved/rejected, so we don't lose track.

*Preliminary Audacious 2.4 support*
  * by PhantomX
  * [http://groups.google.com/group/imms-users/browse_thread/thread/e070e6aeeb75ca28 discussion thread]
  * [http://groups.google.com/group/imms-users/web/imms-audacious.patch Patch file]

*Fix head branch*
  * by PhantomX
  * immscore/fetcher.cc fails on line 71 with LOG(DEBUG). Changing to LOG(INFO) fixes this.
  * Dave S. saw the same thing.
  * Quick fix; can we patch it?
  * Does Mag have DEBUG defined there? Was that custom hacking, or _should_ it work with that?
