A list of patches that need to be reviewed and approved/rejected, so we don't lose track.

*Preliminary Audacious 2.4 support*
  * by PhantomX
  * [http://groups.google.com/group/imms-users/browse_thread/thread/e070e6aeeb75ca28 discussion thread]
  * [http://groups.google.com/group/imms-users/web/imms-audacious.patch Patch file]

*Fix head branch*
  * by PhantomX
  * immscore/fetcher.cc fails on line 71 with LOG(DEBUG). Changing to LOG(INFO) fixes this.
  * Dave S. saw the same thing.
  * Quick fix; can we patch it?
  * Does Mag have DEBUG defined there? Was that custom hacking, or _should_ it work with that?

*Making Torch optional*
  * by Dave S.
  * If we add some '#ifdef WITH_TORCH's, we can make IMMS compile again with --disable-analyzer. This should make Torch optional.
  * This would allow us to port IMMS to windows until such time as we get torch working there
  * Could also allow us to investigate Torch5 to replace Torch3?
  * Is this a direction we want to take IMMS?
  * Is this the right way to do it?
