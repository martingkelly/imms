#summary Tips and notes on contributing code.

= Contributing Patches =

If you want to submit a patch to IMMS, great! Please follow these conventions. When in doubt, be consistent - i.e. follow what's already in the code, so the code itself is a style guide.


 * Prefer // to {{{/*}}} even for multi-line comments
 * Obey the 80c line limit (with the possible exception of URLs)
 * Use spaces not tabs. This makes sure that no matter what a person's tab width is set to the code looks uniform. Usually you can set your editor to substitute tabs with spaces.
 * Always follow // with a space
 * If // is not at the beginning of a line, allow two spaces between it and the code
